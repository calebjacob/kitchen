TODO
====

* Kill Grunt implentation in favor of using just NPM to run automation tasks: http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/
* What to do with the API abstraction? Should it just die or be restructured so that the need for self request()'s can die?
* Research if Swig is really the best for templating
* SVG icon integration: https://github.com/blog/2112-delivering-octicons-with-svg
* Start adding test integration
* Revisit structure of front-end JS (format of directives, etc): http://blog.wearecolony.com/a-year-without-jquery/
* Investigate deployment workflow with Dokku
